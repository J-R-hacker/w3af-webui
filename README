W3AF-WEB is built on

    * Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/).
        Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid 
        development and clean, pragmatic design.

        Developed by a fast-moving online-news operation, Django was designed 
        to handle two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and 
        the stringent requirements of the experienced Web developers who wrote it. 
        It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly

    * Celery (http://celeryproject.org/)
        Celery is an open source asynchronous task queue/job queue based on 
        distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time operation, 
        but supports scheduling as well.

        The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on one 
        or more worker nodes using multiprocessing, Eventlet or gevent. 
        Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background) 
        or synchronously (wait until ready)
